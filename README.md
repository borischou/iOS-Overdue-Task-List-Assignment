# iOS-Overdue-Task-List-Assignment

This app is working fine with functionalities as following:
Creat tasks with title, content, status and date information;
View detail of tasks;
Edit tasks;
Delete tasks;
Re-order tasks
Check if tasks are completed and display the status by different colors;
Change the status of tasks by tapping on task cells

The design of this app is not well formed since the MVC mechanism is not fully applied.
New version of this app is submitted (Good Overdue).
